These are the files for the class: HTML, CSS, and Javascript
from the Ground Up.

demos/demo.html is a fully-integrated page.

Each component on that page has the following:
 *-markup.html (just the barebones html)
 *-template.html (if this is an in-class exercise, use this)
 *.css (the css for this component)
 *.js (possibly, some javascript for this component)

Also, we've put a few templates and handy reference files in
the utilities directory for you as well. Enjoy!
